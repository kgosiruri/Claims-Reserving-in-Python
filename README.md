# 🧮 Claims Reserving in Python

An exploratory project aimed at understanding and implementing claims reserving techniques using Python.

---

### 🔍 Project Overview

This repository investigates claims reserving from both deterministic and stochastic perspectives, with and without economic assumptions. It explores core actuarial models, sensitivity testing, and real-world financial adjustments like inflation and discounting.

### 📌 Key Features

#### ✅ Core Reserving Models Implemented

- **Chain-Ladder Model**  
  Classic deterministic method based on historical development factors.

- **Bornhuetter-Ferguson (BF) Model**  
  Combines a priori loss ratios with Chain-Ladder for stability in early development years.

- **Cape Cod Model**  
  A variant of BF that uses exposure-based weights to estimate expected losses.

- **No-Assumptions Model**  
  A simple baseline without economic or actuarial assumptions, to observe raw claims patterns.

### 🧠 Assumptions-Based Adjustments

- **Inflation Adjustment**  
  Applied using historical inflation data to restate nominal claim values in real terms.

- **Discounting**  
  Future claim payments are discounted using **UK Gilt yield** data to reflect time value of money.

### 🎲 Stochastic Modeling of Claims

- **Frequency Models**  
  - Poisson  
  - Negative Binomial

- **Severity Models**  
  - Lognormal  
  - Gamma  
  - Pareto

- **Aggregate Claims**  
  Total claims simulated by combining frequency and severity — applied across reserving models.

- **Sensitivity Analysis**  
  Testing the impact of distributional choices and economic factors on reserve estimates.

### 📈 Applications

- Understanding and comparing reserving model behavior.
- Visualizing development triangles and projections.
- Evaluating model robustness under economic stress and claim variability.
- Building a base for stochastic reserving extensions (e.g. Mack model, Bootstrap CL).
